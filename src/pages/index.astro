        Welcome to my corner of the Internet!
        <P class='mt-4'>
          I am a software engineer who enjoys finding solutions to various problems. My solutions are usually digital
          software, but thanks to my recent 3D printing hobby, sometimes I get to even build physical solutions.
          <br />

          Feel free to take a look aroundâ€”my portfolio, miniblog, and current projects all live here!

    <H4 text='Why this website?' />
    <P>
      Historically, people used to build entire autobiographies â€” big, heavy books filled with stories, lessons, and
      maybe a few tall tales. I figured, why not have my own little digital autobiography? This website is my way of
      sharing what Iâ€™m up to, what Iâ€™ve learned, and maybe even a few stories of my own (minus the papercuts).
      <br />
      <br />
      Welcome to my cornerâ€”make yourself at home!
